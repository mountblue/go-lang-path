# Go Programming Language

## 1. Go Basics

### Installation

## Install and set up go

Use the [this article](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-go-on-ubuntu-20-04/) to install go.

**NOTE**
1. The version of go mentioned in this article will be out of date. Install the latest version instead.
2. In this article, the go directory is updated in `.profile`, we would prefer you to put the PATH configuration in `.bashrc`.


### Tutorial

Watch and learn from the YouTube video on the basics of go.

**NOTE**
* Use [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/list) liberally.
* You should also maintain a GitHub/GitLab repository with code you learned.
* You should push your code every day. This way the mentors can keep track of your progress.

#### Differences from the video
The video is over a year old and things in golang move fast. Here are some of the differences you have to be mindful of ...

1. Install go versions 1.14.*, the latest stable.
2. In visual studio, install the google official go extension. Not the one mentioned in the video.

### Data Assignment Submission - READ THIS FIRST

One of the following data projects will be assigned to you by the mentor.

#### Instructions

1. Download all the data needed. Consult your mentor if you have any problems accessing the raw data.

2. Initialize a Go project that is GOPATH compatible. Ref: [GOPATH documentation](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH)

3. This project should have a separate repo on Gitlab.com. The mentor will get your project from this repo.

4. **IMPORTANT** All projects should have README.md with instructions on how to ...
     * download source CSV files.
     * get all the libs.
     * compile and run this project.

5. The project should have a .gitignore file. List all IDE files/folders, temp files, data files in the .gitignore.

6. The libs that downloaded with `go get` should be in a folder outside of the repository. The repository **SHOULD NOT** have the source code of libs.

7. The repository should not contain the raw data CSV file. Instead, you should provide instructions in README for downloading this file. And, add the CSV files to .gitignore.

#### Finally
Add the Gitlab URL for your project in this Target

## IPL data set analytics

### Aim

To convert raw open data (run by run records in this case) into charts that tell some kind of story.

### raw data

The data for this exercise is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl/version/5.

*NOTE* you might have to find data sources on your own. For example the country of origin for the Umpires


### What your program should do

From the CSV and other source files specified above, write golang code to ...
1. Read in the data.
2. Write logic to slice / dice / accumulate / transform the data.
3. Using github.com/gonum/plot, plot the plots specified in the following sections.

**Ref:** Example code for the bar plot you are going to use is [here](https://github.com/gonum/plot/wiki/Example-plots#bar-charts)


### Problems

#### 1. Total runs scored by each team

Plot a chart of the total runs scored by each team over the history of IPL.
Hint: use the total_runs field.

#### 2. Top batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore

Consider only games played by Royal Challengers Bangalore. Now plot the total
runs scored by every batsman playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore over the
history of IPL.

#### 3. Foreign umpire analysis

Obtain a source for the country of origin of umpires.
Plot a chart of the number of umpires by in IPL by country. Indian umpires should be ignored as this would dominate the graph.

#### 4. Group chart of matches played by team by season

Plot a group bar chart of the number of games played ...
- by team
- by season

## Analytics on UN Population

### Aim

To convert raw open data, country and year wise population estimates in this case, into plots that tell some kind of story.

### raw data

The data for this exercise is sourced from https://datahub.io/core/population-growth-estimates-and-projections/r/population-estimates.csv

*NOTE* You have construct data for countries in ASEAN and SAARC, references follow ...

* ASEAN countries list
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN

* SAARC countries list
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_Association_for_Regional_Cooperation


### What your program should do

From the CSV and other source files specified above, write golang code to ...
1. Read in the data.
2. Write logic to slice / dice / accumulate / transform the data.
3. Using github.com/gonum/plot, plot the plots specified in the following sections.

**Ref:** Example code for the bar plot you are going to use is [here](https://github.com/gonum/plot/wiki/Example-plots#bar-charts)

### Plots

#### 1: India population over years - Bar Plot

Make a Bar Plot of 'population of India' vs. years, for the years 2005 to 2015.


#### 2: For the year 2014. Bar Chart of the population of ASEAN countries

ASEAN is a collection of Southeast Asian countries. Plot a Bar Chat of the population of
these countries. Only use data for the year 2014

#### 3: Over the years, the TOTAL population of SAARC countries

In this case for **each year** you have to calculate the sum of the population of all SAARC countries. Then plot a BAR CHART of **Total SAARC population** vs. year.
Do this only for the years 2005 to 2015.

#### 4: Grouped Bar Chart - ASEAN population vs. years

In grouped bar charts we can group together may related bar of a single value of the x-axis.
You have to plot the population of ASEAN countries as groups over the years 2004 - 2014.


## Data Assignment :: Interfaces and Packages

With the same data set as the first data assignment, this version you will use more advanced features like interfaces, packages, etc.

## Data Assignment :: Web Version

In this project, you will use the same dataset from the previous 2 projects. In this case, the plots are rendered on the browser using HighCharts, a JavaScript plotting library.

### Part 1: JSON generation [GOLANG]
* Write a go program that takes the CSV file(s) as input, and produces 4 JSON files as output.
* Each JSON file contains the **aggregated data** for each plot of your data assignment.
* **IMPORTANT** the JSON files should **NOT** have all the data from the CSV file. Instead, it should contain result of the aggregations that your program does.
* The structure of JSON should be based on data needed for the HighCharts plot.

### Part 2: Plotting [JavaScript]
* Code HTML/CSS/JavaScript files that will use the JSON files generated in **Part 1** and plot the same plots as in the first Data Assignment.

* Use the [devd HTTP server](https://github.com/cortesi/devd) to serve your HTML/CSS/JavaScript files. **Do open HTML files directly from the file system, use devd to serve your files**

### Part 3: Hosting
Host your HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the generated JSON files on Heroku.

### Submission
When submitting your code, you should submit ...
1. Link to your GitLab / GitHub repository.
2. Link to your hosted page.

## Unit Testing

The youtube video shows the basics of Unit testing in Golang.
